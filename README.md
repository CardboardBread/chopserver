# chopserver
A hybrid of fixed-length, packet-based networking and variable length, signal-based networking

Compiles using `make` into `chopserver` and `chopclient`

chopserver takes no input and only displays messages from clients

chopclient will read from stdin and interpret messages as either text or special commands
