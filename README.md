# chopserver
A hybrid of fixed-length, packet-based networking and variable length, signal-based networking.

Compiles using `cmake` as `chopserver` and `chopclient` executables

Chopserver takes no input and only displays messages from clients.

Chopclient will read from stdin and interpret messages as either text or special commands.
